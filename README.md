# Pilot Bridges

## Description 🚨 
Pilot Bridges is a long-term scalable solution to scheduling challenges faced by airlines, allowing pilots to initiate and negotiate flight pairing trades. This web application utilizes a structured data system, easy to use graphical interface, and doesn't require any changes to American Airline's existing scheduling system. Pilot Bridges is uniquely suited to address the challenges voiced by American Airline's pilots, and is in compliance with recent contractal changes.

# Pilot Bridges

## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯
The #1 highest complaint voiced by airline pilots surrounds scheduling issues. The work-life balance of pilots is rated very poor, and early retirement for pilots is high. Spelman-Jags seeks to find a solution that will increase employee retention through a long-term scalable solution that boosts overall pilot satisfaction.

## Project Description 🤯
Pilot Bridges directly addresses requests from airline pilots at American Airlines. This easy web application is designed to seamlessly work aside American Airline's existing preferential bidding system that schedules pilots. After pilots have been assigned their monthly schedule, they can export their schedule to Pilot Bridges and open flight pairings to be traded. They can filter through pairings that match their requirements and request trades from other pilots using the application. Pilot Bridges also incorporates a notification system and an omnichannel approach so that all necessary features are seamlessly integrated into the application. Pilots will no longer have to to through an informal process that requires days of waiting for higher approval to make trades, and can now have trades instantly approved via the application. 


## Project Value 💰
American Airline pilots voiced complaints for years surrounding their work-life balance. While new contracts have been recently negotiated to allow pilots more flexibility in their scheduling preferences, there has yet to be software built to support those. Now, with Pilot Bridges, airline pilots will experience more independence over their schedule without the airline having to sacrifice productivity.
